# About the data : 

## Fourier Power Spectrum:
This method is used here to break down the light curve in order to understand the period of the light curve.
the idea is that, with Fourier transform the light curve is broken down into multiple curves with different frequencies. each of these decomposed curves have a specific power. Logically, the period of the light curve is deteremined and presented by the frequency of the most powerful curve.

A classical Fourier Transform requires the data to be evenly spaced in time, which is not likely to happen for astronomical observations.(due to weather, etc)
There is a type of Fourier ttansform algorithm used by astronomers, LOMB SCARGLE PERIODAGRAM, which is for unevenly spaced data in time.

## What is Phi_31:
The Fourier phase parameter Phi31 is a characteristic feature of the light curves of RR Lyrae stars, which are a type of pulsating variable stars. The Phi31 parameter is used to describe the shape of the light curve and is defined as the phase difference between the third harmonic (three times the fundamental frequency) and the first harmonic (the fundamental frequency) of the Fourier decomposition of the light curve.

In other words, Phi31 measures the relative phase of the third and first harmonics in the Fourier series representation of the light curve. This parameter is particularly useful for classifying RR Lyrae stars into different subtypes, based on their pulsation behavior.

RR Lyrae stars are important objects of study in astronomy, as they can be used as standard candles for measuring distances to nearby galaxies. The Phi31 parameter, along with other Fourier phase parameters, can be used to determine the pulsation mode of RR Lyrae stars and to estimate their distances with high precision.
