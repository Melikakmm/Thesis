# Estimating metallicity for RR Lyrae stars with the new Gaia data release:
![Test Image 8](Gaia.jpeg)



# Questions:

1. Do I need to consider rp and bp bands beside g band?
2. why the phase for light curves become shorter after using lcfit package?
3. why in the parameter file for lcfit package there are some mean values for the phase21 and phase 31?
